                        I know saying that I love you is pretty generic and may not come off as anything unique. I mean
                        you‚Äôve heard it a thousand+ times at this point. But I don‚Äôt know if you really understand how
                        much I love and care about you. It‚Äôs honestly more than I can put into words. People tend to say
                        that they feel love in their hearts but mine is different from that. I genuinely feel it in my
                        soul. I don‚Äôt think my soul can find peace without you. I think about you LITERALLY every single
                        day. Literally day and night, I‚Äôm wondering how you‚Äôre doing, if you‚Äôre ok, if you‚Äôre feeling
                        good etc. I want to be with you and to be able to care for you. You truly do deserve the best
                        and I know that I can give you that. You deserve someone who loves you as much as I do. I know
                        I‚Äôve done a lot of things in the past that might make you doubt my love for you but most them
                        were done out love for you. I know that I made lots of mistakes with how I tried to show this
                        love to you and I‚Äôm truly sorry for it all. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive and
                        forget those things. If you‚Äôre able to look past those things, you‚Äôll find someone whose heart
                        holds nothing but love for you.

                        No because we literally are. Sure we had our ups and downs but we are literally perfect for each
                        other. Our chemistry is unmatched lmao. We had the type of relationship chemistry that you‚Äôd
                        read about in love stories‚ù§Ô∏è Our conversations can go on for hours and it would never get
                        boring. When we hang out in person, it never gets boring. No matter how long we‚Äôre around each
                        other, we never get tired of each other. It always hurts when we have to leave. This is the type

                        As you already know, I‚Äôm a really introverted person who likes to keep things to myself. I‚Äôm not
                        really comfortable sharing details about my life with anyone, not even with my family which
                        isn‚Äôt very good but I‚Äôm working on it. The only person I‚Äôve been comfortable with truly
                        expressing the way that I feel about certain things is you. And honestly, when I speak to you
                        about them, I feel good afterwards. Thanks for being there for me‚ù§Ô∏è I really do need someone
                        like you in my life. I would like to think that I was your best friend too. There‚Äôs a lot of
                        very sensitive things that you were very open to sharing with me. I‚Äôm not going to mention
                        anything specific because this is a public website lol. I don‚Äôt know how much I showed that I
                        cared about what you had going on but I truly do. Like a lot. Most of them would still be on my
                        minds days after you told me and I‚Äôd be trying to come up with some sort of game plan so that I
                        could help you get through it. Like I literally make it my own personal responsibility to make
                        sure I can help you get through it. You‚Äôre my best friend and I want you to continue being my
                        best friend, from now, until forever.
                        One thing I really like about the way we cultivated this relationship is that we didn‚Äôt just
                        start it off as a relationship, before anything, we were best friends, who talked everyday,
                        shared everything with each other, and got to know each other really good, and then we fell in
                        love. Fuck a book, our love story is worth having its own movie lol.
                        <br><br>SB: This picture is from the first time we met in person. You were so shy üòÇ We had
                        already fallen in love by this point butttt we were very much best friends ‚ù§Ô∏è (SSB, this was our
                        first kiss lmao)

                        This might arguably be one of our best traits. The fact that we continuously push each other to
                        be better version ourselves. In the past, the way that I went about doing this was not proper at
                        all and I‚Äôm truly truly sorry for how I handled everything. Thinking about it now honestly
                        disgusts me and I‚Äôve had to the opportunity to grow from that. I might‚Äôve helped you become
                        better in some ways but I don‚Äôt want to walk too much about that. Instead I‚Äôll mention three
                        ways that you helped me become a better person.
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You helped me understand the importance of being patient in life. I used to be so hard
                                on myself because things weren‚Äôt going the way I wanted but you showed me that sometime
                                you just have to be patient and wait for Allah‚Äôs timing. </li>
                            <li>You helped me adapt better eating habits. I could say a lot about this but one really
                                interesting thing that happened recently that I wanted to tell you about is remember how
                                way back in like 2022, you always got these salads from the Deli and you were trying to
                                put me but my stubborn ass thought it wouldn‚Äôt be good. Well, I recently tried it and it
                                was sooo good. It‚Äôs one of the only things I eat now because I‚Äôm on this whole weight
                                loss journey thing. You kept saying that the deli you got it from was the best and I
                                really want to get it from there lmao. </li>
                            <li>You taught me how to treat the people that I love. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        Also, there‚Äôs much more than this, it‚Äôs just that I have to keep a balance so that the text on
                        this website is not soooo long that you don‚Äôt read it all.
                        <br><br>SB: this is a picture from the first time you put me on to exploring healthier eats cuz

                        to my brothers but they scolded (or at least tried to) me so bad when I told them what was going
                        on with us. They told me how stupid I was and that they need to give me lessons on how to treat
                        women üò≠üòÇwhich is kinda crazy if you think about it. My mom was the first one to tell me that I

                        taking sides but basically what I‚Äôm saying that this family including myself definitely has your

                        As all relationships have their ups and downs, we‚Äôve had ours too. But everything single time,
                        we‚Äôre able to talk through it and resolve whether we had going on. I told you this along time
                        ago and even when I went to your store. I feel like there‚Äôs nothing that me and you can‚Äôt fix.
                        Nothing at all. I feel like we won‚Äôt really have any issues going forward anyway. I‚Äôm truly a
                        changed person now. Like I feel like you‚Äôd be very shocked as to how much personal development I
                        went through in the past few months. A lot of time to self reflect on the things I‚Äôve done and
                        learnt not to do them anymore. I promise you we can get through this and get through whatever
                        else life throws at us. It‚Äôs us against the world baby girl. Never forget that!
                        <br><br>SB: a SS from a random video of us goofing around. This is from the day we went to some
                        building. I think your sister lived there or something ? I‚Äôm not sure. I do remember that you
                        were lowkey flexing on me because your chain here is real gold üòÇyou were so hyped lol. Very
                        cute üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èI recently had to drop my aunts stuff off at that same building and everything about it
                        reminded me of you. We‚Äôve shared so many experiences and details about our personal life with
                        each other, our struggles, our wins, OUR EVERYTHING! Literally lol

                        Love like this is not the type that just pops up out of nowhere. This kinda builds on what I
                        said earlier about the way we fell in love. It started very subtle as just being very close
                        friends and it gradually grew into what it became. It wasn‚Äôt rushed or forced. It all just came
                        naturally and grew into something that‚Äôs truly beautiful. I really don‚Äôt know how to explain. It
                        really just feels like it was meant to be, and I pray to Allah every day that I‚Äôm right, we are
                        meant to be. I know this sounds very extremely corny and I‚Äôve probably said it you before, but
                        I‚Äôll say it again anyways because I feel like it still stands. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what souls are made
                        of, but mine and yours are made of the same thing‚Äù. It‚Äôs a quote a saw awhile ago and you‚Äôre the
                        only person that comes to mind when I think about it. You‚Äôre fr real my soulmate. What we have
                        is special and marrying me would allow us to preserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è

                        you‚Äôre still in phone as ‚Äú‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and four out of my seven lock screens are still pictures of you
                        lmao. Look closely to the left and you might recognize the picture too. You‚Äôre the only person
                        for me tbh. I love youuuuu‚ù§Ô∏è

                        This has to be one of my biggest reasons for wanting to marry you. And it‚Äôs very hard to explain
                        because it‚Äôs a very unique feeling. I‚Äôve never felt it anywhere else or with anyone else.
                        Neither have I really heard anyone describe love like this. You feel like home to me. Like, when
                        I with you, I‚Äôm at peace. I‚Äôm usually very stressed because of everything I have in life but
                        honestly whenever we‚Äôre together, and for as long as we‚Äôre together, none of it seems to matter
                        and I truly just feel calm and at peace. Even that doesn‚Äôt fully explain it but I really hope
                        you get what I‚Äôm saying. The first time I felt like that, I knew right away that you would be
                        the person that I marry. What more could I ask for in a life partner. I find peace in your vibes
                        baby. Being with you feels like coming home after a long day, where everything is simple,
                        familiar, and safe. With you, the world slowed down, and all that mattered is the moment we
                        share together. I feel like I owe you this feeling. I want you to feel home with me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
                        <br><br>SB:This flick is here the definition of peace. In the arms of someone you love, by the
                        river, on a warm summer night. This is peak life right here lol. I like how it feels to be
                        around you. I would like to keep getting that feeling, now and forever.

                I know I‚Äôve been an absolute neglectful piece of shit person and you have every right to hate me for the
                things I‚Äôve done. You‚Äôve already given me a thousand chances to get my shit together and I‚Äôve been to
                blind to see it. I‚Äôm asking you one last time to consider everything. We can make this work. Wallahi we
                can. We love each other a lotttttt. We can get through everything together. I really wish I wiser before
                so that none of this would get happen, but a the same time, Allah is the best of planners. Something
                tells me that all of this had to happen to me ( and to us) for me to really value what I have. For me to
                be more understanding and soft as a person. Like when I tell you I‚Äôve changed, I really did lol. I‚Äôm
                back to being the certified lover boy that you fell in love with and I‚Äôll be like this for the rest of
                my life. I really want to marry you and make you happy. Please forgive me for the way I‚Äôve been
                recently. Let me help you heal, let me there for you, as your partner, lover and husband. Baby girl I
                genuinely love you. I know you‚Äôre skeptical of whatever I say because of the past but this is really
                just the beginning of our story. We have the rest of our lives ahead of us. Compared to that, this is
                going to seem like a speed bump. Let me devote the rest of my life to showing you what love should
                really feel like. Please forgive me and let‚Äôs start our next chapter. I love you‚ù§Ô∏è
                These past few months have been really hard for me. I have this new playlist that helps keep me sane and
                these are the songs from it that remind me of you the mostüëå‚ù§Ô∏è Check them all out if you can.

                Last but not least, may Allah bless you in everything you do! May he bless you with happiness and
                goodness in your life and make you happy. May he make a source of happiness for you. May he make us
                better for each other. May he make it easier for you to look past my mistakes. I‚Äôve changed, Wallahi I
                have. Like I don‚Äôt even look at life the same anymore. My whole perspective on everything has been
                shifted. I really wish that we would get past this. I think you‚Äôd love the new me so much üò≠
                I‚Äôm very determined to correct all the mistakes I made along the way so that this is all cleared up. A
                few weeks ago, I wanted to call your dad, uncle (daman) and granddad to ask for their forgiveness. The
                way I handled the situation was absolutely unacceptable. Like honestly thinking about it all now, I
                don‚Äôt know what was going through my mind. I‚Äôm so sorry you had to deal with me in that state. I didn‚Äôt
                end up contacting them because one of my family members advised me not to, because that not what really
                happens in soninkara or something like that. I still want to do it but not until I asked you about it
                first. You know them more than me. Do you think they‚Äôd appreciate something like that ? If so lmk. I
                really want my in laws to like me. I know I messed up a lot but now I‚Äôm simply asking for a chance to
                redeem myself and fix what I‚Äôve broken. I love you baby. I really really reallly do. I want to spend the
                rest of my life with you. You truly are the only person for me‚ù§Ô∏è. Once again, I Love You‚ù§Ô∏è!
