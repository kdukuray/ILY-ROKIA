                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A few weeks ago, I was told that it‚Äôs best for me to move on because you‚Äôve moved on. Since
                        then, I‚Äôve been trying to process everything but for some reason, nothing is clicking for me.
                        I‚Äôve been feeling this way for months now. Since I left your store that night in July, I‚Äôve been
                        praying that Allah shows me what to do and guides me because I felt more loss than I ever have
                        in my whole life. Here I was trying to right my wrongs and everything in my life keeps falling
                        apart even more. The people that I love and care about more than anything have been the subject
                        of my neglect and as I try to fix what I‚Äôve broken, the pieces break into even smaller pieces. I
                        told you that between then, and when I saw you in September, I dreamt about you 6 times. I kept
                        praying and just kept on seeing myself go back to you in my dreams. For me, that sign couldn‚Äôt
                        be any clearer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you more than anything and truly do care about you so much. You know I do. I literally
                        cannot put it into words. Till this day, I wake up every morning thinking about and go to sleep
                        wishing I could say goodnight to you. It really does feel like loosing a part of myself and the
                        thought of never getting it back truly does break my heart. I try not to think about it for too
                        long because it always brings tears to my eyes. I know a grown man of my stance especially,
                        shouldn‚Äôt come to tears so easily but gangsters got feelings too lmao. At the end of the day,
                        the heart wants what the heart wants and my heart wants you. Even the day that I saw you in
                        front of your building to give you those flowers, I kept telling myself that I‚Äôd be strong and
                        not get too emotional, but things obviously didn‚Äôt go as planned. As soon as I saw you, I swear
                        my heart skipped a beat and started racing like it was about fall out my chest. You looked as
                        beautiful as ever, with the same smile that I fell in love with all those years ago. I kept
                        asking you to repeat what you said, not because I couldn‚Äôt hear you, but because I kept getting
                        lost in your eyes. Just seeing you that day brought so much warmth to my soul because I was
                        really in a dark place. In that moment, the only thing I wanted was to get out the car and hold
                        you, let you feel my heart for yourself and tell you how sorry I am. That would also give me an
                        opportunity to wipe any tears that came out so that you wouldn‚Äôt have to see mr.tough guy cry
                        lmao. That‚Äôs why o kept telling you to park, I needed a few seconds to get my sh*t together
                        üò≠but eventually, it really was just too much and that‚Äôs why I rolled my window up. I missed you
                        so much and even as I type this rn, I miss you soo soo much. I want to be with you, I want to
                        hold you, to show you that I‚Äôm a good person and the right person for you. I really would give
                        up everything to have you again. I honestly don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll ever truly be happy without
                        you. I want to be able to care for you and love you. I know that I‚Äôve made so many mistakes.
                        Sooo many, more than I can count, but I swear to Allah I‚Äôm willing to do whatever it takes to
                        correct them all. I swear that I‚Äôll dedicate myself to making you happy, because that‚Äôs what
                        makes me happy.

                        Fun Fact:
                        Since we spoke last time in front of your building, I've dreamt of you twice lol.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These past few months have been some of the most rough in my entire life. I don‚Äôt know what
                        hurts more, losing you as my lover, or loosing you as my best friend, because you were both of
                        those things to me. This entire time, I‚Äôve been walking around with a hole in my heart that can
                        only be filled by your presence. There are so many instances where I see or experience something
                        and the little voice in my head tells me that ‚ÄúRokia would‚Äôve loved to hear about this‚Äù. It
                        really gives me this weird feeling that I can‚Äôt shake. On one hand, it feels good to remember
                        you, on the other, it hurts remembering that you‚Äôre not with me anymore. I know it may be hard
                        for you to really believe that I‚Äôve changed and become better but I really have.The things that
                        happen in life are all learning experiences, and I‚Äôve had a lot of learning lately.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I really wish I could sit with you in person and talk to you because I have so much to tell you.
                        I feel like if you gave me a chance to talk to you properly, you‚Äôd understand üòîI truly do love
                        you so much I swear ‚ù§Ô∏è
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I could‚Äôve been those people who just text and call you non stop from different numbers and
                        continued trying to go to your shop and what not but I respect your privacy and I don‚Äôt want to
                        be some type of disturbance to you. As much as I love you and want to see you, I know how to
                        respect people‚Äôs boundaries. I don‚Äôt want you to ever feel like I‚Äôm bothering you in anyway. And
                        that‚Äôs why I updated the website. I added a link at the top that‚Äôll take you back to the
                        original site with the ‚Äúreasons we should get married‚Äù. With this new page, whenever I have
                        things to say to you, or things that I want to tell you, I‚Äôll just post them here under a new
                        date. That way, they‚Äôre never getting in your way. Whenever I think about you, or have something
                        that I wish I could tell you, I‚Äôll just add a new section with a new date and hopefully, one day
                        you‚Äôll think of me and check. It‚Äôs not the same as actually talking to you but it‚Äôs better than
                        just keeping everything to myself‚ò∫Ô∏è

                        If you ever want to leave a comment for any of the sections, here‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.kalelodukuray.com/#contact-page-content">link to the contact
                        section on my personal website</a> üôÇ the website might look funny on your phone because I didn‚Äôt
                        have time to design it properly for mobile screens yet but the contact form still works lol.

                        I miss you baby. I really really do. I hope you‚Äôre doing good and that life is treating you
                        well. May Allah continue to bless you and grant you all the goodness this world has to offer
                        because you really do deserve the best. I love you, forever and always! ‚ù§Ô∏è
